"Hello world" has become the traditional first program for many people involved in computer science (Programming), so I think there is not a better way to start again this space.

In this occasion I choose Pelican to build it, simply because is very easy to use and all entries are simply rst files, at the end this space is only for storing my thoughts, experiences, tips and other some daily adventures.
